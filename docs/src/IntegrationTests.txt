Integration tests are performed by Selenium in a real environment,
including a real Firebase RT Database. Before running the test, the
database is cleared of all data (so make extra sure that there isn't
anything important in the database referenced in your Firebase config
file).

You must have the Chromium driver on your path to run the tests.
