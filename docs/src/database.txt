#################################### About #####################################

The database module provides common interfaces and the Firebase
database, mainly including wrappers for the database schema.

This is its own separate module and is compiled and managed
independently from the others. It must be recompiled separately when
changes are made to it.

Note that this does not contain all the required code for interacting
with Firebase. Each service must independently manage its connection
to Firebase while using this module to interact with the schema

############################## Build Instructions ##############################

npm run build

This MUST be done after any code changes in order for those changes to
be reflected in the actual code.
