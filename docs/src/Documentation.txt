Modelcollab is an application that lets multiple users collaborate in
real-time on creating simulation models. This is accomplished using a
React/Typescript/Firebase frontend, and a backend which consists of a
Typescript endpoint which fetches the simulation data from Firebase,
interprets it into Julia code, then runs a Julia application to
produce results for the model.

At this time, models are not checked for correctness, and results are
written directly into CSV and PNG files and stored on the server.

React components for the front end are stored in the Components directory
Code for the back end is stored in the Compute directory



############################## Firebase Emulators ##############################

The tests are run using a simulated firebase environment. This
requires you to install the firebase local emulator suite, and before
running the tests you must authenticate with google using
`firebase login`. Required emulators are 'auth' and 'database'

The Firebase emulated environment will be used when
applicationConfig.js has 'isProduction: false'.
