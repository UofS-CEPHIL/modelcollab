## About

ModelCollab is a web-based collaborative modelling application with

handled in Julia through StockFlow.jl.

ModelCollab is written by Eric Redekopp and Long Pham of the
University of Saskatchewan CEPHIL lab with support from Dr. Nathaniel
Osgood. StockFlow.jl is written by Xiaoyan Li and Nicholas Meadows of CEPHIL
who have also worked closely with this project.
