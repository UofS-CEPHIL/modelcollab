# ModelCollab

## About

ModelCollab is a web-based collaborative modelling application with
the front end in Typescript, React, and Firebase, and the modelling
logic in Julia.

ModelCollab is written by Eric Redekopp and Long Pham of the
University of Saskatchewan CEPHIL lab with support from Dr. Nathaniel
Osgood, and makes great use of Xiaoyan Li's Julia framework, StockFlow.jl.

Design documentation and build instructions are available in the wiki of this Github repository.
